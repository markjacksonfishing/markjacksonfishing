### Greetings,

My name is Mark Jackson. I am the founder and AI developer in residence at [Anuclei](https://anuclei.com), where we are at the forefront of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence innovation. I hold a BA and a master's degree from MIT. A strong foundation in my personal and professional life grounds me. I cherish time spent with family and friends, and I am an avid supporter of the San Francisco Giants.

#### Professional Journey

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with leading technology companies, such as Blue Cross of California, Yahoo!, Symantec, HP, AT&T Labs, Sysdig, Hightail (formerly YouSendIt), Equinix Metal (formerly Packet), and Jasmine Multimedia. My professional journey has also been shaped by my service in the United States Army, where I have contributed to high-stakes operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

#### My Role at Anuclei

In my role at Anuclei, I lead the development of advanced AI-driven solutions, designing scalable and secure data pipelines and artificial intelligence systems across sectors, including healthcare technology. Previously, as Chief Technologist at Booz Allen Hamilton, I led mission-critical AI and software solutions for the Air Force/Space Force. At Equinix Metal, I managed distributed systems for cloud automation, applying machine learning to optimize operational efficiencies.

#### Personal Interests

Beyond professional pursuits, I am a culinary enthusiast. I contribute my own and others' recipes to the [cloud-native community cookbook](https://github.com/cncf/cloud-native-community-cookbook). Additionally, I enjoy bass fishing, a pastime that brings balance and peace.

I look forward to connecting and sharing my expertise in AI and machine learning. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me.
