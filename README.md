#### Professional Journey

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with leading technology companies, such as Blue Cross of California, Yahoo!, Symantec, HP, AT&T Labs, Sysdig, Hightail (formerly YouSendIt), Equinix Metal (formerly Packet), and Jasmine Multimedia. My professional journey has also been shaped by my service in the United States Army, where I have contributed to high-stakes operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
