#### My Role at Anuclei

In my current role at Anuclei, I have been at the forefront of developing innovative solutions in healthcare technology and creating scalable, secure infrastructure solutions. My previous experience as Chief Technologist at Booz Allen Hamilton allowed me to lead technical solutions for high-stakes projects, particularly with the Air Force/Space Force, where I delivered mission-critical systems with precision and efficiency. At Equinix Metal, I was a Senior Software Engineering Manager, managing critical projects and architecting distributed systems for cloud control and automation.

#### Personal Interests

Outside of my professional endeavors, I am a culinary enthusiast, contributing to the [cloud-native community cookbook](https://github.com/cncf/cloud-native-community-cookbook) with my own and others' delightful recipes. Additionally, I deeply enjoy bass fishing, a hobby that brings me peace and a deep connection with nature.

I look forward to the opportunity to connect and share my knowledge and experiences. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me.
